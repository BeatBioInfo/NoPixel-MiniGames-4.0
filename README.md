# NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator
 A web-based project designed to replicate/build similar "hacking" challenges that can be found on the NoPixel 4.0 FiveM Server. 
 > Developed using HTML, CSS, TS (Compiled to JS).

- ## [SmokeCrack v.1.0.0](https://maximilianadf.github.io/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator/SmokeCrack/SmokeCrack.html)
  ### Description
  SmokeCrack is the **new** 'Wi-Fi Hacking' app that can be found on the NoPixel 4.0 computer, It's price is 3BUTCOIN. The app seemed to be malfunctioning upon it's initial release, for instance, the Timer visually stopping but never actually stopping (causing all attempts to result in 'Hacking failed!'). Thankfully the minor bugs were quickly patched. here's some examples of it's __functionality__:
  - [The first group to experiment with the app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9G7aPbJMT4&ab_channel=NoPixelClips)
  - [Mr.K & his group realising the app is 'scuffed'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvhRpxT-XmA&ab_channel=LordKebunClips)

  ### Thoughts
  __If anyone has the background-image or font for the original SmokeCrack app, let me know__

  ### Instructions
  If you want to try the hacking out for yourself I have made a replica of the program. It's almost identical to it's original on the NoPixel 4.0 server (Slight color & formatting mismatches) but overall the same functionality. Follow the instructions below to run the program locally.
  - Head to the [repository's main page](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator)
  - In the top right corner, click on the green box '<> Code'.
  - Click on 'Download ZIP'
  - Extract the 'NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator-main.zip' folder
  - Open the folder that's extracted
  - Open the 'SmokeCrack' folder
  - Lastly, open SmokeCrack.html in your preffered web browser
  
  The 'MAC Address' and 'IP Adress' fields work but are not connected to anything (simply cosmetic). To begin the hacking mini-game press on the 'Crack' button. A range of characters (8-16) will appear and you need to type them in order without any interventions. If you manage to press all characters correctly on your keyboard before the timer runs out, you win. Have Fun!
