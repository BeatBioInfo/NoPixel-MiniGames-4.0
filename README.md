# NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator
 A web-based project designed to replicate/build similar "hacking" challenges that can be found on the NoPixel 4.0 FiveM Server. Any and all **input** is appreciated greatly; create an [issue](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator/issues) regarding suggestions, improvements or questions, I will respond as soon as possible.

   ### Description
   The new Roof Running job that recently popped up on NoPixel 4.0 is built around stealing AC units from the roof's of buildings. Stealing the AC units require a screwdriver which through the above minigame loosens the AC unit and lets the player pick it up. The game consists of a 5x5 grid with 25 differently colored cubes (Red, Green Blue). Cubes of the same color that are connected (Meaning more than 2 cubes are next to one another) can be removed by clicking on them. The remaining cubes fall downwards and align to the left of the screen. Singular cubes of a specific color can not be removed since they're not a pair of more than 2. The game is completed succesfully if all 25 cubes have been removed within the 15 second time constraint

   ### Thoughts
   There are still some problems left to fix, mainly regarding the solvability:
   - Instances where the generated game can not be completed
   - The game not automatically failing whenever there is no solution

  ### Description
  SmokeCrack is the **new** 'Wi-Fi Hacking' app that can be found on the NoPixel 4.0 computer, It's price is 3BUTCOIN. The app seemed to be malfunctioning upon it's initial release, for instance, the Timer visually stopping but never actually stopping (causing all attempts to result in 'Hacking failed!'). Thankfully the minor bugs were quickly patched. here's some examples of it's __functionality__:

  ### Thoughts
  __If anyone has the background-image or font for the original SmokeCrack app, let me know through an [issue](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator/issues)__

  ### Instructions
  If you want to try the hacking out for yourself I have made a replica of the program. It's almost identical to it's original on the NoPixel 4.0 server (Slight color & formatting mismatches) but overall the same functionality. Follow the instructions below to run the program locally. The continously-updated hack can also be found online at [github pages](https://maximilianadf.github.io/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator/SmokeCrack/SmokeCrack.html)
  - Head to the [repository's main page](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator)
  - In the top right corner, click on the green box '<> Code'.
  - Click on 'Download ZIP'
  - Extract the 'NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator-main.zip' folder
  - Open the folder that's extracted
  - Open the 'SmokeCrack' folder
  - Lastly, open SmokeCrack.html in your preffered web browser
  
  The 'MAC Address' and 'IP Adress' fields work but are not connected to anything (simply cosmetic). To begin the hacking mini-game press on the 'Crack' button. A range of characters (8-16) will appear and you need to type them in order without any interventions. If you manage to press all characters correctly on your keyboard before the timer runs out, you win. Have Fun!

  ### Description
  LockPicking played a major role in NoPixel 3.0 but was a fairly simple hack. In NoPixel 4.0 it has now transformed into a more complex yet more intuitive hack. The uses of lockpicking have not yet been fully explored nor "released" to the server. The lockpick's objective is to crack each of the 4 "locks" (circles) by aligning the balls with their corresponding color indicators. The hack is less forgiving than previous iterations and has a 20 seconds time-duration before the lockpick gets bent. Clips of the lockpick in __action__:

  - ðŸ”— [Mr.K stunned by the lockpick's complexity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ6XPkKDd4w&ab_channel=LordKebunClips)
 
  ### Thoughts
  __Through watching some more videos it seems like the locks can also be rotated using the cursor/direction keys, will be implemented in future versions.__ If you have any input create an [issue](https://github.com/MaximilianAdF/NoPixel-Hacking-Simulator/issues)

  ### Description
  The RepairKit game has the same functionality in 4.0 as it did in 3.0. The difference is the minigame's apperance/ui which has been revamped and turned into a more sophisticated design. It's a simple MiniGame of timing your button press correctly to align the moving square with the indicated slot. It's substantialy easier than the other MiniGames of this repository.

  ### Thoughts
  The coloring can use some touches to make it more like it's NoPixel 4.0 counterpart. Furthermore adding a highsore, current score counter alongside a possible difficulty setting that alters the moving-speed of the square. Will be justified in future versions. Problem where you can press E multiple times causing a speedup/buggy next game
